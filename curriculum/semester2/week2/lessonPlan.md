Week 2: Assembly Required (again)
Thanks to the incredible team work with the construction class, we were able to make the proper adjustments on the mirror and are ready to go forward.

We are still going to be assembling the magic mirror and getting it ready for production. Here's the current list of things to complete:

- [X] Update design to be the desired layout 
- [X] Communicate with constuction group on the layout of the frame
- [ ] We will need to add the ability to auto start the raspberry pi so the mirror can be turned on and off without a hiccup. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mREl2Gza0g) and refer to [this tutorial](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/auto-starting-magicmirror) to learn how.

- [ ] Check with the pi-switch to see if the auto start is running correctly
Adding content to the mirror:

- [ ] Add Vocatio school events to the public calendar.
- [X] Add text to be displayed and shuffled through.
- [ ] Configure lights with new setup. We used Yeelights that needs an app to configure and connect to the wifi. During certain times, light changes need to happen (like in between classes / when you should be in class)

- [ ] See how we can add alexa configurations with the microphone and speaker! (this would be really exciting!!!).
