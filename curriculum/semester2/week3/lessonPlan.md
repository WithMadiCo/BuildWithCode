# Week 3: Alexa Skill

This week we will be going through several Alexa tutorials to build a trivia game. We collaborated with Mr. Matt to use some World History trivia the students have been learning throughout the semester. This touches on some of the programming knowledge we've been learning more about throughout this CEI project.

These are the tutorial we've been following the next couple classes:
