# Week 10 : PRESENTATION DAY

Today is the final day for class, which means the students get to showoff all the things they've done throughout the semester. To highlight a few things, check out the list below:

- **Animate Your Name**: Activity using Scratch programming language to program an animation of their name. Students introduced themselves by telling and showing me a little about them. 

- **Lit Jingle Bells**: Using Raspberry Pi's, students programmed several programs incorporating lights and sound. At the end they were able to make the raspberry pi and arduino to sing jingle bells with flashing lights.

- **Github**: Each student set up their own Github account, to make them a certified hacker. They were able to learn the similarities between the computer's organizational system and when to use local development and the benefits of centralized code base. 

- **Cryptography**: We learned how to hack the wifi (or at least how the passwords are encrypted). We did a hacking activity where we created our own cryptography key and hash for the other students to try to hack. 

- **Binary**: Learning how computers communicate was a fun ativity that incorporated applied math subjects. Students learned how to count in binary and how to abstractly determine the value of a larger binary number.

- **Website**: We created a simple html wesbite with basic information about ourselves and incorporating the basic fundamentals of html.

- **Smart Mirror**: Our ongoing project throughout the semester, creating a smart mirror with Raspberry Pi. We used an open source project and contributed on top of it, adding our own customizations.
