# Building With Code Curriculum

_Last Updated: December 13th, 2018_

--------

**Date**: December 14th, 2018 - March 15th, 2019  
**Grade / Student Experience**: 9th Grade w/ little to no experience in computer science  
**Class Schedule**: 10 weeks of 135 minutes sessions  
**[Supply List](https://github.com/WithMadiCo/IntroToTechnology/blob/master/curriculum/supplyList.md)**:
- Computer (one for each student is best)
- Text Editor (we're using [Atom](atom.io))
- Two-Way Smart Mirror
- Raspberry Pi
- Frame for the mirror
- LED Monitor with Speakers
- USB Microphone
- Smart Light Tape
- [Alexa Skill Documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/steps-to-build-a-custom-skill.html#step-2-set-up-the-skill-in-the-developer-console)

**Purpose**: To teach students with little knowledge of computer science about how technology products are created, giving them exposure to more than just the software development aspect. To inspire students and the community of the vast opportunities that computer science and technology create.  

**Class Structure**:  
_Exposure_  
- Technology role within the industry
- Companies that have that sort of role
- What you'd want to study to learn more about that role

_Education_
- Foundations of programming concept
- Required to attend the coding bootcamp
- Connection with classroom education  

_Experiment_
- Try it out!!
- Play / Fail / Learn
